# Nix Configuration for AMD Ryzen 7 with NVIDIA 1660Super
*Note: There is nothing here yet. The config will be here soon*

This is my n00b Nix configuration for my desktop rig. I don't think that there is anything groundbreaking here. I have included some gaming specific config as well as NFS mounts and other bits and pieces specific to my config. This config is mainly a learning experience for me and I am publishing it as a backup for my rig but also a bit of code for other to learn from.

## System Hardware Configuration

Although the hardware should not matter too much, my configuration has been tested on:
- Motherboard: Asus Strix B550-I Gaming
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x16GB
- NVMe 1: Samsung 970 EVO Plus 1TB
- NVMe 2: Sabrent Rocket 2GB
- GPU: Gigabyte NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super OC 6GB
